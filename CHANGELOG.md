# EMS-ESP Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.9.5 beta]

### Added
- Solar Module SM200 support
- `set master_thermostat <product id>` to choose with thermostat is master when there are multiple on the bus
- MM10 Mixer support (thanks @MichaelDvP)
- MM200 warm water circuits (https://github.com/proddy/EMS-ESP/pull/315)
- First implementation of writing to Junker Thermostats (thanks @Neonox31)
- Added model type (Buderus, Sieger, Junkers, Nefit, Bosch, Worcester) to device names
- `boiler wwonetime` command from Telnet
- `set bus_id <ID>` to support multiple EMS-ESP circuits. Default is 0x0B to mimic a service key.
- MQTT publish messages are queued and gracefully published every second to avoid TCP blocks
- Added `mqtt_nestedjson` option to disable multiple data records being nested into a single JSON string
- Support for Moduline 200 and Sieger ES72 thermostats

### Fixed
- set boiler warm water temp on Junkers/Bosch HT3
- fixed detection of the Moduline 400 thermostat
- RC35 setting temperature also forces the current select temp to change, irrespective of the mode

### Changed
- improved MQTT publishing to stop flooding. `publish_time` must be at least 1 (second)
- External sensors (like dallas) are sent as a nested MQTT topic including their unqiue identifier
- `mqttlog` console command renamed to `mqttqueue`

### Removed
 - `autodetect scan`
 - `mqttlog all` and showing MQTT log in the web interface - no point showing history of previous mqtt publishes in ESP's precious memory. For debugging I recommend using MQTT Explorer or another external tool.

## [1.9.4] 15-12-2019

There are breaking changes in this release. See `publish_time` below and make sure you set this value to 0.

### Added

- Added `publish_always` forcing MQTT topics to be always sent regardless if the data hasn't changed
- Support for DHW once (OneTime water) heating command via MQTT [issue 195](https://github.com/proddy/EMS-ESP/issues/195)
- Added scripts to automatically build firmware images on every Commit/Pull and nightly builds using TravisCI
- Added option to WebUI to also download the latest development build
- Added build scripts for automated CI with TravisCI
- Implemented timezone support and automatic adjustment, also taking daylight saving times into account
- Added `kick` command to reset core services like NTP, Web, Web Sockets
- Added WiFi static IP (setting done in WebUI only)
- `log w <type_id>` for watching a specific telegram type ID
- initial support for EMS+ GB125s and MC110's (https://github.com/proddy/EMS-ESP/wiki/MC110-controller)
- Buderus RFM200 receiver

### Fixed

- Stability for some Wemos clones by decreasing wifi Tx strength and adding small delay

### Changed

- Debug log times show real internet time (if NTP enabled)
- `system` shows local time instead of UTC
- fixed version numbers of libraries in `platformio.ini`
- Normalized Heating modes to `off`, `manual`, `auto`, `night` and `day` to keep generic and not Home Assistant specific (like `heat`)
- Keeping Thermostat day/night modes separate from off/auto/manual, and setting this for the Junkers FR50
- Removed `publish_always`
- Changed NTP interval from 1 hour to 12 hours
- Refactored EMS device library to make it support multi-EMS devices easier (e.g. multiple thermostats)
- `autodetect deep` removed and replaced with `autodetect scan` for scanning known devices.
- MQTT data will be sent when new data arrives. So `publish_time` is used to force a publish at a given frequency (2 mins is default), or 0 for off.

### Removed

- thermostat scan and autodetect deep functions
- removed Event Logging to SPIFFS (worried about wearing). Replaced with SysLog.

## [1.9.3] 2019-10-26

### Added

- Report # TCP dropouts in the `system` command. These could be due to WiFI or MQTT disconnected.
- Added temp and mode to the MQTT `thermostat_cmd` topic
  
### Fixed

- vertical bar showing in WebUI sidebar menu using FireFox

### Changed

- Heartbeat MQTT payload is now in JSON
- platformio.ini targets. Use `debug` for custom builds.

## [1.9.2] 2019-10-19

#### Important! This build has breaking changes:
 - MQTT topics have changed. Use the `mqttlog` command to see the names of the subscriptions and the format of the payload data. Also reference the [Wiki page](https://github.com/proddy/EMS-ESP/wiki/MQTT).
 - Home Assistant `.yaml` files need updating to reflect the recent MQTT changes
 - The web builder has been upgraded to use Gulp 4. Remove `tools/webfilesbuilder/node_modules` and re-install the libraries using `npm ci` from within the `tools/webfilesbuilder` folder

### Added

- Handling of Mixing Module MM100 Status Messages (thanks @kstaniek)
- Retrieve/Set thermostat mode for Junkers FW100/120 thermostats (thanks @Neonox31)
- Added sending of all Mixer Module data via MQTT (thanks @peclik)
- Improved handling of MQTT publish and subscribe errors
- Added MQTT QOS (`mqtt_qos`, default 0), Keep Alive (`mqtt_keepalive`, default 60 seconds) and Retain (`mqtt_retain`, default off) as parameters to both telnet and WebUI

### Fixed

- `publish` command also sends Dallas external temperature sensor values
- `log_events` setting wasn't persisted in config file

### Changed

- External dallas sensor values sent in MQTT payload as float values and not strings
- All MQTT topics for the Thermostat have the Heating Circuit appended (e.g. `thermostat_data1`). This includes the commands.
- Shower timer and shower alert and not MQTT published at boot up
- Heating Active logic change to use Selected Flow Temp of min 30 instead of 70 (https://github.com/proddy/EMS-ESP/issues/193)
- Cleaned up Telnet messages during bootup to only show key information.

### Removed

- Removed telnet command `shower timer` and `shower alert` to toggle the switches

- added check for corrupted event log, which could happen due to SPIFFS writing while UART is active
- made Junkers work again (broke in 1.9.0)

### Changed

- Added tx_mode back with options 0,1 and 2 until we've fixed option 2 that works for everyone and doesn't reset ESP
- More solar module data captured, thanks to @Vuego123
- Detect thermostat mode for EMS+ RC300/Moduline 3000
