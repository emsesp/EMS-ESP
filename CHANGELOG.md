### Changed

- upgraded MyESP library
- minor changes

## [1.5.5] 2019-03-07

### Fixed
- Support the latest ArduinoJson v6 and espressif8266 2.0.4 libraries (in PlatformIO do a `pio lib update` and `pio update`)

## [1.5.2] 2019-02-04

### Changed

- Change wifi settings using the `set wifi <ssid> <password>` command

### Added

- Added incoming MQTT "TOPIC_BOILER_WWACTIVATED" to set the warm water on/off. Payload is 1 or 0. See [issue](https://github.com/proddy/EMS-ESP/issues/46#issuecomment-460375689).
- Added the list of all MQTT topics to the README file

## [1.5.1] 2019-02-03

### Fixed

- issue with Serial monitoring conflicting with UART when both running
- Fixed typo with -D settings in the example platformio.ini

### Changed

- `thermostat temp` now except floats (e.g. 20.5). Some thermostats may round up or down if they use 0.5 intervals.

## [1.5.0] 2019-02-03

### Added

- Support for RC10 thermostat
- New command `set serial`

### Changed

- Improved Tx logic. Retries are more efficient and startup is faster and less error prone.
- "# Rx telegrams" and "# Tx telegrams" show number of successful Reads and Writes initiated by the user or automatically by the code. This makes it easy to see if the Tx is working.
- Some refactoring in preparation for the EMS+ support coming soon

### Removed

- Removed the `poll` and `tx` commands
- `DEBUG_SUPPORT`. Now controlled with the 'set serial' command
- removed MQTT and WIFI settings from my_config.h. These have to be set either within the application (using set) or hardcoded in platformio.ini You can now check in `my_config.h` without everyone seeing your passwords! 
- TxCapable removed from `info` 

## [1.4.1] 2019-01-29

### Added

- The led pin, dallas pin and both thermostat and boiler type IDs can be set with the application, and stored.

### Changed

- some minor improvements to autodetect

## [1.4.0] 2019-01-27

### Changed

- last will MQTT topic prefixed with a header like the rest of the topics
- All double and float numbers rendered to 2 decimal places (precision = 2)
- Default logging set to None when starting a telnet session

### Added

- Added support for external Dallas sensors (DS1822, DS18S20, DS18B20, DS1825). See readme
- Added UBAParametersMessage type to fetch boiler modulation min & max values
- Report shows system load average

## [1.3.2] 2019-01-23

### Fixed

### Changed

- Improved way to identify if the EMS bus is connected
- Improved 'types' command to show more details
- Improved auto detect of thermostat types

### Added

- added un tested supporting RC35 type of thermostats
- Try and discover and set Boiler and Thermostat types automatically
- Fetch UBATotalUptimeMessage from Boiler to get total working minutes
- Added check to see if bus is connected. Shown in stats page
- If no Wifi connection can be made, start up as a WiFi Access Point (AP)

- Implemented FIFO circular buffer queue for up to 20 Tx messages (Q command to show queue)
- Toggle Tx transmission via telnet (use 'X' command)
- Show thermostat type in help stats (use 's' command)
- Show version is help stats (use '?' command)

### Changed

- Improved overall formatting of logging
- Include app name and version in telnet help
- Improved method to switch off hot tap water in Shower Alert
- Telnet P and M commands have changed
- Enabling Logging in telnet is now the 'l' command
- Logging is set back to None when telnet session closes
- Improved fetching of initial boiler values to post to MQTT at startup
- Improved handling and retrying of write/Tx commands

### Removed

- Hid access from telnet to the Experimental custom function command 'x'

- Removed NO_TX define in platformio and replaced with system parameter 'command X'
- Removed -DDEBUG option in build
- Removed wwtemp MQTT messages to set the boiler temp. You'll never miss it.
- Removed LEDs for Tx, Rx and Err. Too many flashing lights and it drains the current.
- Removed capturing of last Rx and Tx times
- Support for older RC20 thermostats

### Known Issues

- There's a nasty memory leek when in telnet's verbose mode with sending which causes the EMS to reset when running for a while.
