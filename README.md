## **Credits**

A shout out to the people helping EMS-ESP get to where it is today...
- **@MichaelDvP** for all his amazing contributions and patience. Specifically for the improved uart library, thermostat and mixer logic.
- **@BBQKees** for his endless testing and building the awesome circuit boards
- **@susisstrolch** for writing a first working version of the EMS bridge circuit which I used to design EMS-ESP version 0.1 back in August 2017
- plus everyone else providing suggestions, PRs and the odd donation that keep us motivated. Thanks!
